# Zeteo 🔍
A **minimal** implementation of `grep` written in rust.
## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tonie-ng/zeteo.git
cd zeteo
cargo build --release
```

## Usage
Navigate to the project directory type in the following
```bash
cd target/release
./zeteo pattern file
```
Where `pattern` is the string to find and `file` is the file to search in.
You can also run `./zeteo --help` to see available commands.
> **Note**: the help command is not properly documented, at least not yet.

Thank you.
